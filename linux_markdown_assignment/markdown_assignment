## Part 1: Markdown Exercise
This section involves creating a `README.md` file and writing documentation using Markdown syntax.
The document includes structured information with headings, lists, and formatted text.

## Part 2: Linux Exercise
In this section, Linux commands are used to create a new directory named `markdown_linux_assignment`.
Inside this directory, a `README.md` file is created and edited using the `nano` text editor to include the required Markdown content.

## Part 3: Git Version Control
Git is initialized in the `markdown_linux_assignment` directory to track changes. The `README.md` file is added to version control using `git add`,
and a commit is made with `git commit` to save the changes in the local repository.
